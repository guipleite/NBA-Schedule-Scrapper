# Sports-Schedule-Scrapper
This project is a web scrapper API that compiles the games of, time and result in a given date. At this time it is using ESPN's website as base and scrapping it's content into a Python dictionary.

  To run the program use Python 3 and pass the date in the DD/MM/YYYY format:
  
    python3 data_scrapper.py "DD/MM/YYYY"

Currently only supporting the NBA
